# BASICODE on the ZX Spectrum - A Story

Let me introduce myself. My name is Jan Bredenbeek from the Netherlands. In 1983, I bought a Sinclair ZX Spectrum. At that time, I was also aware of the Hobbyscoop radio programme with its BASICODE-2 transmissions. So I asked the NOS if there was a BASICODE translator program available for the Spectrum. It turned out that there wasn't one (of course I should have bought a C64 instead - just joking :)). However there was a guy named Rik Koevoets working on a ZX81 translator, to be aired on Christmas Day that year. And despite the fact that a ZX81 is not a Spectrum, I did have a ZX81-to-Spectrum conversion program, typed in from pages of listings in the Your Computer magazine, so I thought that would finally enable me to load the BASICODE programs I had recorded from the radio.

Well, eventually Christmas Day 1983 came and my Christmas present arrived. Well, sort of. I spent nearly all of the Christmas holidays trying to run the ZX81 translator on my Spectrum. Eventually I succeeded, but it still needed a lot of tweaks to just read in BASICODE programs, let alone to run them. Nevertheless I regard those days as sweet memories. I did learn a lot about Z80 Assembly language programming, and also a lot about ZX Spectrum machine code disassembling and hacking ;-)).

A couple of months later, the 'official' NOS BASICODE-2 book and cassette arrived, including a ZX Spectrum translator also from Rik Koevoets. But to me it appeared somewhat as a disappointment. Writing a BASICODE translator for the Sinclair machines is not an easy task given the incompatibilities of ZX Basic, but on the Spectrum almost no BASICODE program would run without manual intervention. There was the 'one-letter variable name' issue so a name like IN$ was 'illegal', like line numbers above 9999. The Spectrum had only a 32-column display where BASICODE expected 40. And when you did a DIM A$(10), you would get a 'string array' of 10 single characters - and always 10, since ZX Basic treated the last subscript as a 'length' parameter! Similarly, LEFT$ MID$ and RIGHT$ were missing (but there was a quick workaround by defining them as FN L$/M$/R$). All in all, It was so tough that even the BBC decided to bring out a modified BASICODE to be able to run it on the Sinclair machines - much to the discontent of the original Dutch inventors.

As 1984 progressed, more Spectrum enthousiasts embarked on writing a better Basicode translator. One of them was Herman Ament, who wrote a more user-friendly program that included code to allow for a 42-column display and automatic replacement of 'illegal' line numbers and variable names. But still, the incompatibilities between Sinclair and BASICODE (read: Microsoft) Basic proved to be a barrier I wanted to get rid of. So... I decided to hack Sinclair's Basic to make it compatible with BASICODE!

Nowadays, this would seem to be an impossible task given the complexity of software and copyright issues. But in the Spectrum era there was a book called 'The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly' by Ian Logan, which was considered as THE bible to ZX Spectrum machine code programming. Also, all Spectrums sold were equipped with the same ROM version so programmers could happily use the ROM routines without having to bother about versions (at least at that time). Needless to say there were already a lot of 'extended Basics' available for the Spectrum, but none of them addressed the issues faced with BASICODE. So I had to do it myself...

By 1985, I was already in contact with Hans G. Janssen from the NOS Hobbyscoop team. He was aware of the challenges Spectrum users faced with Basicode and welcomed my attempt to make a 'translator program to end all previous translator programs' for the Spectrum with enthousiasm. Eventually, it took me about 5 months to write it (as a student I had a bit of spare time then...) and in June 1985 it finally aired. It was also included in the new edition of the BASICODE-2 book and cassette (for obscure reasons named BASICODE-2A), which arrived just in time for the HCC dagen (then Holland's biggest computer fair) in November 1985.

But work wasn't finished, and the BASICODE-3 standard was already under way. In the year that followed I did a complete rewrite of the Spectrum translator, adding the graphics and file management features and making the Basic faster. Sadly enough, the launch of BASICODE-3 in June 1986 was troubled by the conflict between the NOS and the BASICODE Foundation over copyright issues, resulting in a split-up. The NOS continued to air programs in the old BASICODE-2 standard while the Foundation found a new broadcast partner in the TROS, which started to air BASICODE-3 programs in July 1986.

There are more stories to tell, like the visit from a delegation of Radio DDR in early 1989, when the Berlin Wall was still in place. A year and a half later, they proudly presented the East-German version of BASICODE, with programs 'auf Schallplatte'!. I still have that book and record... Unfortunately, the German unification also meant the end of the German project. Two years later, in 1992, BASICODE transmissions in the Netherlands also ended sadly...

So, what's left of it? I still have lots of tapes with radio recordings and BASICODE-3 'verzamelcassettes'. But are they still usable? YES! Even while I don't have a ZX Spectrum anymore (sadly), I have discovered that my translator program still works perfectly on the numerous ZX Spectrum emulators available today. Even more, I managed to 'fast load' BASICODE programs at a speed unthinkable those days! I just need to convert all my tapes to .WAV files and let Spectaculator do its job.

Also, I managed to find the entire source code of my project from the '80s. It's thousands of lines of Z80 assembler and very scarcely commented so I guess it will take some time to find out what I was doing back then. But anyway, that's also the fun of it...

## Epilogue

This story was written in 2016, and in the three years since there have been some developments. All BASICODE-2 and BASICODE-3 programs which have been aired are now available in ASCII form at [Rob Hagemans's BASICODE archive](https://github.com/robhagemans/basicode). The object and source code of my latest BASICODE-3 translator program, which has now been documented to a large extent, is available [here](https://github.com/janbredenbeek/ZXSpectrum-Basicode).

If you want to run BASICODE programs from this archive, the easiest way will probably be through Rob's [BASICODE Interpreter](https://github.com/robhagemans/basicode-interpreter). Alternatively, you can use my [BASICODE-3 translator for the Sinclair QL](https://github.com/janbredenbeek/QL-Basicode) which can read and translate BASICODE programs directly from ASCII files (unlike the Spectrum's interpreter, it can run at 2019-like speeds when using an emulator such as QPC2).


Have fun,

Jan.
